<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">My idea is to look at Netflix original shows that were cancelled after only one season. I plan to look at all of these measures to see if there are patterns or outliers in the shows that were cancelled:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Viewership Stats (both hours watched and total watches [hours watched/length of show])</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Cost to Produce/Market (if available)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Rotten Tomatoes Rating</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="9">Genre(s)/Categorization in Netflix</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">For viewership stats, I can pull data from 2023-2025 from Netflix’s Engagement Reports, which have been compiled <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/most-popular/netflix-engagement-report-search/">here</a>. Rotten Tomatoes ratings will obviously be available on Rotten Tomatoes, which can potentially be scraped or individually input depending on the volume of data. I’m not sure where to find production and marketing costs, or if that’ll even be publicly available for all of the shows I’m looking at yet. I’ve found a dataset with genre information on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhargavchirumamilla/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows-till-2025">Kaggle</a>, so that’s already settled.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">For this, I will be using an inferential model to determine correlation between viewership, rating, and genre and cancellation/lack of renewal.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">This research will be important to both executives/stakeholders in knowing which shows are most likely to be cancelled after only one season (vs. ones that will be renewed and likely more profitable), as well as consumers to reveal the reasoning behind cancellation and whether they can expect other shows they enjoy to be renewed or cancelled down the line.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Since all of this data will be public (except for possibly costs), there is no ethical issues with data usage. This model could potentially assist in future creation or production, as well as make the process more transparent for consumers/subscribers.</p>
